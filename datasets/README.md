### TLS/SSL scans

The TLS/SSL scans that we used in our longitudinal analysis can be found [here](https://opendata.rapid7.com/sonar.ssl/). In our study we used HTTPS GET requests on port-443. More specifically, in our analysis we use the ```_hosts``` and ```_certs``` files.

According to the Rapid7 dataset [documentation](https://opendata.rapid7.com/sonar.ssl/): 

> The ```_hosts``` files provide mapping between the IPs/endpoints and the fingerprint of the X.509 certificate presented.
> The ```_certs``` file provides a mapping of the net new certificates from a given study and the corresponding fingerprint. The _names file provides a mapping of the X.509 certificate name (CN) to its fingerprint.

According to Rapid7 

The dataset contains a collection of metadata related to the net new X.509 certificates observed in each study when considering all SSL studies that ran prior. The _hosts and _endpoints files provide mapping between the IPs/endpoints and the fingerprint of the X.509 certificate presented. The _certs file provides a mapping of the net new certificates from a given study and the corresponding fingerprint. The _names file provides a mapping of the X.509 certificate name (CN) to its fingerprint.
